# Booklist

Hi! So, my task is ready for review: ) The task was made with the help of cool framework Angular4.0 and such libraries as Bootstrap, MomentJS, UnderscoreJS. Of course it can be done better with a bigger amount of components, RxJS, unit tests and without a bugs;) ... but not in a such tiny time period))) You know where to find me :)

## Run application

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
Clone project (git clone ...)
cd booklist
npm install
ng serve
```

## From angular documentation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
